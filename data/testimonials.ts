    testimonial:
      "I was very skeptical at first. Trading always felt complicated and risky. After choosing a 60-day plan, I realized how simple it was — deposit funds, let the AI trade, and just monitor the daily earnings credited to my account. Watching it grow over time changed my mindset completely.",

    name: "Sophia Martinez",
    designation: "Marketing Consultant",
    testimonial:
      "What surprised me most was how hands-off everything is. No charts, no strategies, no decisions. I selected a 30-day period, deposited once, and the AI handled the rest. Seeing earnings show up daily made it very reassuring.",

    designation: "Remote Developer",
    testimonial:
      "I’ve lost money trading on my own before, so I didn’t trust this immediately. Locking funds for 90 days sounded scary, but seeing daily profits reflected in my account and transaction history built confidence over time.",

    name: "Emily Carter",
    designation: "Freelancer",
    testimonial:
      "I don’t understand markets at all, and that used to stop me from investing. With this platform, I just picked a duration, deposited money, and monitored the daily returns. No control needed — which honestly made it less stressful.",

    name: "Jason Lee",
    designation: "Product Designer",
    testimonial:
      "The biggest relief for me was not having to make trading decisions. Once my funds were locked in, I just checked the daily earnings as they came in. It feels structured, predictable, and very well thought out.",

    designation: "Entrepreneur",
    testimonial:
      "Committing funds for a fixed period made me nervous at first. But seeing profits credited daily and logged clearly in my transaction history helped me trust the system. Now I understand the value of letting the AI work uninterrupted.",

    name: "Chris Nolan",
    designation: "Operations Manager",
    testimonial:
      "There was no learning curve at all. I chose a 60-day plan, deposited once, and simply tracked performance daily. Not having control over trades actually removed a lot of emotional pressure.",

    name: "Ann Lamar",
    designation: "Content Strategist",
    testimonial:
      "I told myself I’d try a 30-day plan just to see how it works. Watching daily earnings accumulate without having to touch anything was surprisingly satisfying. It’s seen as long-term, not instant gratification.",

    testimonial:
      "What sold me was the structure. You commit for a set number of days, the AI trades without interference, and you monitor daily progress transparently. It feels disciplined, not speculative.",
